* Use Azure D-Series VM sizes for increased performance and consistency.
* Deploy and create templates with Temp Disks that are consistent with Azure.
* Marketplace Syndication allows you to use content from the Azure Marketplace and make available in Azure Stack.

## <a name="infrastructure-and-operations"></a>Infrastructure and operations
* Isolated administrator and user portals and APIs provide enhanced security.
* Use enhanced infrastructure management functionality, such as improved alerting.
